            <p>Andrew was a product of the strenuous European apprenticeship program,
                a course of study so demanding that it took years to complete. 
                All students started by learning that any job-no matter how small-was to be
                done the right way,
                with care and attention to detail. Raw apprentices were assigned
                a broom and cleaning supplies and expected to master their use before 
                moving on to more formal training that included mathematics, welding,
                machine operation, and scientific principles
                commonly reserved for engineering students.</p>

                  <br><br>

                  <p>And so it went, one step at a time, with dogged and unrelenting persistence,
                    and an unfailing belief in his ultimate success,
                    a set of values passed on to his son.</p>

                      <p>Since that hectic weekend in 2009, QubiTunningAtelier has continued to thrive. 
                        The staff has grown fivefold. 
                        That extra floor space available on moving day? 
                        Filled long ago with parts, products, and equipment.</p>
