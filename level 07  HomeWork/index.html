  <h1><center>Husky</center></h1>

  <h2>Etymology</h2>
  <p>
    The term "husky" first came into usage in the mid to late 1700s. At this
    time, "Esquimaux" or "Eskimo" was a common term for pre-Columbian Arctic
    inhabitants of North America. Several dialectal permutations were in use
    including Uskee, Uskimay and Huskemaw. Thus, dogs used by Arctic people were
    the dogs of the Huskies, the Huskie's dogs, and eventually simply the husky
    dogs. Canadian and American settlers, not well versed on Russian geography,
    would later extend the word to Chukotka sled dogs imported from Russia, thus
    giving rise to the term Siberian husky.

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    Nearly all dogs' genetic closeness to the gray wolf is due to admixture.
    However, several Arctic breeds also show a genetic closeness with the
    now-extinct Taimyr wolf of North Asia due to admixture: the Siberian Husky
    and Greenland Dog (which are also historically associated with Arctic human
    populations) and to a lesser extent, the Shar Pei and Finnish Spitz. An
    admixture graph of the Greenland Dog indicates a best-fit of 3.5% shared
    material; however, an ancestry proportion ranging between 1.4% and 27.3% is
    consistent with the data and indicates admixture between the Taimyr wolf and
    the ancestors of these four high-latitude breeds.

  <h2>Characteristics</h2>
  <p>
    Huskies are energetic and athletic. They are distinguished by their
    hardiness and cold-weather tolerance, in contrast to many modern sprint sled
    dogs derived from hound and pointer crossbreeds and purebred sprinting dogs
    which do not have or retain these qualities. Likewise, they are
    distinguished from laika, as they were not developed for the primary purpose
    of hunting game and prey animals.

  <h2>Breeds</h2>
  <h3>Alaskan husky</h3>
  <p>
    The most commonly used dog in dog sled racing, the Alaskan husky is a
    mongrel bred specifically for its performance as a sled dog. The modern
    Alaskan husky reflects 100 years or more of crossbreeding with English
    Pointers, German Shepherd Dogs, Salukis and other breeds to improve its
    performance. They typically weigh between 18 and 34 kg (40 and 75 lb) and
    may have dense or sleek fur. Alaskan huskies bear little resemblance to the
    typical husky breeds they originated from, or to each other.

  <h3>Labrador Husky</h3>
  <p>
    The Labrador Husky originated in the Canadian region of Labrador. The breed
    probably arrived in the area with the Inuit who came to Canada around 1300
    AD. Despite the name, Labrador huskies are not related to the Labrador
    retriever, but in fact are most closely related to the Canadian Eskimo Dog.
    There are estimated to be 50-60 Labrador huskies in the world.

  <h3>Siberian Husky</h3>
  <p>
    The Siberian Husky is smaller than the similar-appearing Alaskan Malamute.
    They are descendants of the Chukotka sled dogs bred and used by the native
    Chukchi people of Siberia, a people of Paleosiberian origin, around the year
    2000 BC. Imported to Alaska in the early 1900s, they were used as working
    dogs and racing sled dogs in Nome, Alaska throughout the 1910s, often
    dominating the All-Alaska Sweepstakes. They later became widely bred by
    recreational mushers and show-dog fanciers in the U.S. and Canada as the
    Siberian Husky, after the popularity garnered from the 1925 serum run to
    Nome. Siberians stand 20-23.5 inches, weigh between 35 and 60lbs (35-50 for
    females, 45-60 for males), and have been selectively bred for both
    appearance and pulling ability. They are still used regularly today as sled
    dogs by competitive, recreational, and tour-guide mushers.
